                                                INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) What is the use of abstract method?
   -abstract method is used for two reasons:
   1.Force the subclass developers to provide implementation
   2.Achieve Standardization of method signature
  
2) What do you mean by abstract method?
   1.A method which is declare only in the method signature but no implementation 
     is Called as incomplete method or abstract method.
   2.An abstract method is created by using the keyword "abstract".
  *3.If any class contains an abstract method then the class must also be  declare as "abstract".
   4.The abstract method must be completed in the immediate sub class.
     If it is not completed in the immediate sub class then the class must be declare a abstract
     and the method can be completed in the next level of sub class.
   5.A static method cannot be declare as abstract.
   6.An abstract method can never be declare as final.
   
3) Is it compulsary to declare any class as abstract?
   No,A class should be declared as abstract only in any of two situations:
   1.If the class contains any abstract method then the class must be declared as abstract.
   2.When we don't want to allow any one to create Object of the class
 
4) Can a class contain both abstract method as well as concrete method?
   Yes,A class can have both abstract and Concrete methods but class must be declared as "abstract".
   
5) Can an abstract class contain only concrete method?
   Yes.
   
6) Can we constructor for an abstract class?
   Yes and it will get executed by the help of super() call in sub class constructor
   
7) Can we create an abstract class as final?
   No,because abstract class may contain abstract method which has to be completed in the subclass.
   if you declare the abstract class as final then we cannot create its subclass which means we cannot 
   complete the abstract method.hence, abstract cannot be declared as final.
   
8) What do you mean by Data Abstraction?
   1.The process of hiding background details and providing only a essential features is called as
     Abstraction.
   2.Abstraction can be achieved by the help of abstract classes and interfaces.
   
   NOTE:-Hiding background details means not providing implementation to the method.
        -Providing essential features means providing only the method signatures to the users.
        -In projects the sub class developers does not have to worry about the implementation
         designed by super class developer.The subclass developer has to worry about what implementation
         has to be provided to the method in the subclass.

9) What is the Disadvantage of abstraction using abstract class?
   We cannot achieve multiple inheritance using abstract class.

10) What are the limitations of abstract class?
    1.we cannot create object of abstract class.
    2.We cannot achieve 100% abstraction because abstract class can contain abstract method as well as concrete method.
    3.we cannot achieve multiple inheritence using abstract classes

11) What is an interface?
    1.Interface is a type definition block.
    2.It acts as a contract that tells what a class can do.

12) What are the characteristics of an interface?
    1.In an interface by default all the variables are:'public static final'.
    2.All the methods are'public abstract'.
    3.Interface doesn't have constructor.Hence,we can achieve multiple inheritence.
    4.We can achieve 100% abstraction using interface.
    
13) How does an interface shares its properties to another interface?
    By using 'extends' keyword.

14) How does a class gets the properties from an interface?
    By using 'implements' keyword.

    ARRAYS
 --------------   
1) What is an Array?
   1.Array is a Contigous memory location used to store multiple number of Homegeneous elements 
     together in a shared memory.
   2.The array is fixed in nature.
   3.In an array we can store only same type of data.
   4.We cannot add any extra element to array once it is created.
   5.Array can be created in 
      1.using new keyword
        int arr[]=new int[size];
      2.directly assigning value
        int arr[]={10,20,30};
      3.directly assign value with new keyword
        int []arr=new int[]{10,20,30};       



public class Base{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int []arr=new int[5];
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter
    
    
    for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
      arr[i]=Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());
      }
      sopln("All elements entered successfully");
      sopln(
      for(int i=0;i<arr.length(arr[i]){
      arr[i];
      }
