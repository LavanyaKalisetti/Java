  Output: 
  B) It is used to perform an action without interfering with the elements
  
  Explanation:
  The "peek" method in the Java Stream API is an intermediate 
  operation used mainly for debugging purposes or performing actions 
  on each element without modifying the stream.
  -It does not alter the stream elements.
  -Itâ€™s commonly used to log or inspect the elements as they flow through the pipeline.
