/*Output:B) A sequence of data elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially.

In Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects in a functional style. 
A Stream represents a sequence of elements supporting sequential
and parallel aggregate operations such as filter, map, reduce, etc.

-It does not store data, it just conveys elements from
 a source (like a collection, array, or I/O channel).

-It is different from data structures like List or 
 Setâ€”streams are not meant to store elements.
