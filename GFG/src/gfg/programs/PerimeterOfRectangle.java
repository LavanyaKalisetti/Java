/*Java Program to Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle:-
 
  A Rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles (90Â°). 
  In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. 
  A rectangle with all four sides equal is called a Square. 
  A rectangle can also be called as right angled parallelogram.

  The sides A and C are equal and B and D are equal.
  
  The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its four sides. 
  It can be simply calculated by all its four sides.
  Perimeter of rectangle ABCD = A+B+C+D
  
  Since the opposite sides are equal in a rectangle, 
  it can be calculated as the sum of twice of one of its side and twice of its adjacent side.
  Perimeter of rectangle ABCD = 2A + 2B = 2(A+B)
